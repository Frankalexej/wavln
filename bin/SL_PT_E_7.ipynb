    "Version 2:  This version has a core structure using HM-RNN. Unlike traditional approaches, our model can automatically detect boundaries. It is trainable and updates the upper layer only upon detecting boundaries. This makes our model suitable for detecting boundaries and capturing the representations of sub-segments based on these detected boundaries. In essence, our model performs boundary detection and representation learning simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version 3: this version completed the coding of the core model structure as well as the dataloading, preprocessing, padding and loss calculation processes. At present we only try mel->model -> mel structure, since wav <> wav would introduce extra complexion. In addition, our model will process padded multi-batch tensors as normal but count for the paddings (ignore paddings) during calculation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Version 4: this version is testing whether our hmrnn is not working. It imports a modified version of model: model_test\n",
    "\n",
    "Version 5: this version is testing phase two, mainly working on preprocessing modifications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Version 6: this version deletes lin2, as this will destroy the predicted segmental boundaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Version 7: After learning from Dr Coupe, I added an additional linear layer. Also, I am trying to make the first inter-linear dimension to be even larger, so as to enrich the representation power of our model. "

    "总的来说分成四个，神经网层来进行降维处理，得到的损失比较大，但是 hcv值倒是接近不过，如果能尽量的接近原作的模型结构，我们就不去动它了，所以可能目前来看最好的是保留两个降为层加上两个残差层，最后从256降到2，也许是最好的结果当然降到4也是可以的，都是比较低的维度，不过如果我们想要直接能够，在，可视的空间中画出这些点来，2或者3可能会比四更好一些。 "

    "Adding new data slightly improves the performance of the model in HCV score, in addition, shuffling the training data largely lowers the HGV score perhaps we should discuss this phenomenon and justify use no shuffling during training. Perhaps this is because of some sort of phonotactics or naturalness of sound streams. "
