    "Version 2:  This version has a core structure using HM-RNN. Unlike traditional approaches, our model can automatically detect boundaries. It is trainable and updates the upper layer only upon detecting boundaries. This makes our model suitable for detecting boundaries and capturing the representations of sub-segments based on these detected boundaries. In essence, our model performs boundary detection and representation learning simultaneously.\n",

    "Version 3: this version completed the coding of the core model structure as well as the dataloading, preprocessing, padding and loss calculation processes. At present we only try mel->model -> mel structure, since wav <> wav would introduce extra complexion. In addition, our model will process padded multi-batch tensors as normal but count for the paddings (ignore paddings) during calculation. \n",

    "Adding new data slightly improves the performance of the model in HCV score, in addition, shuffling the training data largely lowers the HGV score perhaps we should discuss this phenomenon and justify use no shuffling during training. Perhaps this is because of some sort of phonotactics or naturalness of sound streams. "
